More pointers, arrays, and strings

Synopsis

This repository holds some projects I worked on for ALX Software Engineering. The goal is to learn coding and concepts through the C programming language.

Concepts to be learned in this repository:

* What are pointers to pointers and how to use them
* What are multidimensional arrays and how to use them
* What are the most common C standard library functions to manipulate strings

Description of what each file shows:
0. a function that fills memory with a constant byte (memset)
1. a function that copies memory area (memcpy)
2. a function that locates a character in a string (strchr)
3. a function that gets the length of a prefix substring (strspn)
4. a function that searches and returns a pointer to a byte matched in a string (strpbrk)
5. a function that locates a substring (strstr)
6. a function that prints the chessboard
7. a function that prints the sum of the two diagonals of a square matrix of integers
8. a function that sets the value of a pointer to a char
9. a file that contains the password for the [crackme2 executable]
